# Quizzler App

<p>
  The quizzler app generates a random 10 question true or false quiz using a user interface and pulling questions from an API.
  The user is notified whether the guess is correct using a flash of color, green for the correct answer and red for wrong answer.
  The UI is rendered using tkinter and questions/answers are monitored by the quiz_brain python Class. This python project was created
  while following along to Dr. Angela Yu's 100 days of code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp.
